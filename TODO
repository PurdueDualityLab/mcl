clxdo or other script to compute distances for line-based <LABEL> <CID> cluster format


! statsReset moved. valgrind it.

 -  mclxVectorDispatch why is matrix argument not const.

 -  update/point README compile instructions

 -  mcxarray unit tests
    implement full re-compute of ranks in case of NAs + spearman?

 -  mcxsubs reimplement; mcxi or lex/yacc
  - consider also tf()

 -  mcx{load,dump} restrict tab: report intersect and difference (useful sanity-check feedback for user).

 -  hidden options in clm close should be part of other clm mode.

 -  why are mclxSub and mclxChangeDomains not more alike?
    (physical moving of column vectors in the latter).

 ?  matrix read on clustering (intra-edges only -- help --force-connected)

 !  mclExpandVector / mclvKBar should use pval rather than float?

 -  mcxi uses 'int' for integers. Why not long?

 -  fast colsizes in mcx query with binary format.

 -  mcx query -vary-threshold with 20x21 matrix L == 0 - better NA.

 -  (clxdo) easy way to generate top and bottom clusterings.
    paste <(seq 0 1 $((10-1))) <(yes 0 | head -n 10) | recol 21 | mcxload -123 -
