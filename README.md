# mcl
Markov CLustering or the Markov CLuster algorithm, mcl is a method and program
for clustering weighted or simple networks, a.k.a. graphs.  It is accompanied
in this source code by other network construction and (trait) analysis
programs.

## Applications and bioinformatics
MCL has been used a lot in the field of bioinformatics, starting with the TribeMCL
method published by Enright, van Dongen and Ouzounis.
A lot (too much) of information and documentation is available
at [micans.org](http://micans.org/mcl) .

## Status and plans
The program mcl has been very stable or nearly unchanging for well over 15
years now, with the last speed optimisations occurring about a decade ago. I
aim to do some development in its sibling programs, including improving those
that implement (currently somewhat inelegant) mini-formats such as `mcx alter`
and `mcxsubs`. Another reason for new releases is that new compilers and
compiler settings have unearthed two or three blemishes in the code base that
needed fixing.

I aim to make a new release, the first since mcl-14-137 (released at about day 137
in the year 2014), in autumn 2021. A development release (mcl-21-257) is available,
please have a look at the dev branch.

If you have suggestions, please get in touch or open an issue.
